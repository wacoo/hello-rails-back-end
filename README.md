<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Hello Rails Back-End <a name="about-project"></a>



**Hello Rails Back-End** is a tutorial exercise project focused on integrating Rails and React. As the back-end component of the application, its primary function is to provide an API endpoint that returns a random greeting in JSON format.

The purpose of Hello Rails Back-End is to demonstrate the seamless integration between Rails, a robust Ruby-based web framework, and React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. By following this tutorial exercise, developers gain hands-on experience in connecting the two technologies effectively.

The app's core functionality lies in its API endpoint, which generates a random greeting. Whenever a client sends a request to the designated endpoint, the back-end selects a greeting from a predefined list and returns it as a JSON object. This showcases the versatility of Rails in handling API requests and generating JSON responses.

Hello Rails Back-End offers developers the opportunity to explore and enhance the project further. This may involve expanding the greeting options, customizing the response structure, implementing authentication, or integrating additional APIs. These exercises deepen understanding and refine skills in building scalable web applications using Rails and React.
